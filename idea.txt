Idea : 

The idea is not fleshed out yet but it moves somewhere around the fact that there are 2 players (or more) 
are there playing against each other, they have these agents (one or more, not thought anything about that) 
who are have some task (maybe something like capture the flag, or something simple like KILL THE ENEMY) but 
the twist here is that they don't control these agents directly, they are controlled by the code which the 
player writes before the round begins, after all the rounds are done (there are fixed number of them) the 
one with higher score wins. May be there are pickups, and powerups and other things. May be there are land
features which are needed to be dealt with.
